## Description
ACEseq (Allele-specific copy number estimation with whole genome sequencing) is a tool to estimate allele-specific copy numbers from WGS data and comes along with a variety of features:
* GC/replication timin Bias correction
* quality check
* SV breakpoint inclusion
* automated estimation of ploidy and tumore cell content
* HRD/TAI/LST score estimation 
* with/without matched control processing 

## Prepackaged files

ACEseq is available as Docker version and as Roddy-based version for execution in hpc clusters.
Both versions can be downloaded from http://bfg-nfs3.ipmb.uni-heidelberg.de. 

The prepackaged zip file contains a full Roddy / Plugin setup and includes different scripts to 
install all necessary software and download the required reference files.

Further information about the usage and installation of both versions can be found at our Read The Docs website: (http://aceseq.readthedocs.io).

#### Conda

The workflow contains a description of a [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) environment. A number of Conda packages from [BioConda](https://bioconda.github.io/index.html) are required. You should set up the Conda environment at a centralized position available from all compute hosts. 

First install the BioConda channels:
```
conda config --add channels r
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --add channels bioconda
```

Then install the environment

```
conda env create -n ACEseqWorkflow -f $PATH_TO_PLUGIN_DIRECTORY/resources/analysisTools/copyNumberEstimationWorkflow/environments/conda.yml
```

The name of the Conda environment is arbitrary but needs to be consistent with the `condaEnvironmentName` variable in `resources/configurationFiles/analysisCopyNumberEstimation.xml`.

#### Other

If you do not want to use Conda, you can get a complete list of all packages and package versions Conda would install from the `resources/configurationFiles/conda.yaml`.
