Requirements
=============

Hardware
--------
ACEseq requires the execution of multiple jobs that are highly parallelized in the beginning but linearize towards the end of the workflow. It requires a maximum of 50g RAM in few of the Jobs. On a HPC cluster with multiple cores available it will usually finish within 24h (100-160 CPU h). The final output usually requires between 4 and 6g memory.

Software
--------
The installation of all required software can be found under :ref:`installation`.
