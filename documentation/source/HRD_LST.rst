HRD, LST, TAI
=========================

HRD, LST and TAI scores are provided in the file ${pid}_HRDscore_${ploidy}_$tcc} for each solution.

HRD and LST are merged based on smoothed segments as suggested by Popova et al. (doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1470).

TAI are based on unmerged segments. A combination of the three scores might be useful.
